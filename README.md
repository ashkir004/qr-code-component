## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- Responsive Image
```css
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    display: block;
    border-radius: 1em;
}
```

- Single-screen fixed-layout design
```css
body, main {
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0 auto;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

> A journey of a thousand steps starts with one step.

My continued development will focus on building more complex layouts, improving accessibility, and learning advanced CSS techniques such as grid and animations. I plan to tackle more Frontend Mentor challenges and explore responsive design for various devices.


### Useful resources

- [Semantic HTML](https://web.dev/learn/html/semantic-html) - This helped me understand HTML is best done when focused on the semantics. Looking forward to practising it.
